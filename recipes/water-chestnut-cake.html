        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>125 g water chestnut flour</li>
            <li>5 water chestnuts</li>
            <li>190 g sugar (any type)</li>
            <li>700 ml water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir 150 ml water and the water chestnut flour together and 
            wait 10 minutes to stir again.</li>
            <li>While waiting, add the rest of the water and sugar to a large 
            pan on low heat. Wait until it begins to boil.</li>
            <li>Mince the water chestnuts and add them to the pan. Turn off 
            the heat.</li>
            <li>When the pan begins boiling again, stir it into the other 
            mixture and stir the completed mixture again.</li>
            <li>Steam the mixture for 20 minutes. You can test it by using a 
            toothpick which will come out clean if it's done.</li>
            <li>Allow the cake to cool completely and serve. Optionally you 
            can cool it in the fridge to serve cold or pan fry it to serve hot
            </li>
