            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 eggs, whisked</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cups frozen peas</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked and chilled rice</li>
            <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan over 
            medium-high heat until melted.</li>
            <li>Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. 
            Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.</li>
            <li>Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat 
            until melted.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a 
            generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or 
            until the onion and carrots are soft.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons 
            of butter, and stir until melted.</li>
            <li>Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster 
            sauce (if using), and stir until combined. Continue sautéing for 
            an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Add in the eggs and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and 
            stir in the sesame oil until combined.</li>
            <li>Taste and season with extra soy sauce, if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up 
            to 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
